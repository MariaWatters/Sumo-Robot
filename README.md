# Sumo-Robot

This project is an Arduino Robot that utilizes 3-4 HC-SR04 sensors,
2 infrared sensors, 2 brushless DC motors, a motor shield, and a 6V supply.
This robot will push others out of an arena.
The body of the robot must be within 8x8 inches, but it can be made
out of any material. We chose Arduino as our platform.

Currently working on Sumo Code improvements. As of now:
Improvements to US sensor code and to IR sensor code - simplified and condensed
3 out of 3 ultrasonic sensors tested as functional
1 out of 3 infrared sensors tested as functional
Motor control fixed - no longer turning uncontrollably
Serial printouts added to monitor progress
