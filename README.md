# Sumo-Robot

This project is an Arduino Robot that utilizes 3-4 HC-SR04 sensors,
2 infrared sensors, 2 brushless DC motors, a motor shield, and a 6V supply.
This robot will push others out of an arena.
The body of the robot must be within 8x8 inches, but it can be made
out of any material. We chose Arduino as our platform.
